<ul>
  <li>It is very creative. I like how they thought about the similarities in shape of a dolphin and a banana, and made it into a piece which resembles both.</li>
  <li>Really liked the tail of the dolphin as it looks like the inside of a banana peel. Very creative indeed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It looks a little too perfect for a banana. Most bananas develop black spots as they ripen. Maybe if they wanted for a more realistic interpretation of a banana, they could add a few black spots here and there, and it would not take away from the beauty of the dolphin.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything is drawn realistically. The hand is nicely drawn, the lighter is setting the Earth ablaze, and I really like how the artist showed the area in and around Antarctica is on fire as a result of the lighter. There could be many themes which could be derived from this pice.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It was a little hard to tell whether the white on the Earth was ice or clouds. They were painted with the same color. If there was a little contrast between the two, it would probably make the Earth actually look like the Earth with distinct clouds and ice patches.</p>
