- A lot of these alumni are majoring in engineering, CS, and cogsci (mainly going into UC)
- Some people did compsci at a really young age... some started from 2nd grade
- Other majors could have CS in it
- Profound interest in compsci
- could be a struggle early on with github and other things...
- **Google is your friend!**
- Focus on your own path and your own curve... it does not matter where other people are
- Some hard transition to college based on content taught
- Motivation could be easily lost and a lot of people will cut corners... have the "above and beyond" mindset
- UCSD Mech engineering: one hands on project in freshman year and one hands on experience in senior year
- CS courses do have projects... they have PBLs and exams
- PBL embedded in compsci in UC
- Lot of copy pasting and coverting data types... write a script to take input and create it into another input.
- **Coding is everywhere!**
- Lots of data types, loops, and other statement which are handy for engineering projects
- Jupyter notebooks are used for technical notebooks and interactive notebooks... hence coding comes in handy
- Resumes come in clutch... applying for a job
- Interacting with a lot of people...
- Databases, python scripting, web development... all taught in CSP
- AP CSA and other courses also secures someone an internship. 
- Personal projects always help... lots of companies look for that
