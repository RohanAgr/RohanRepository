## Final Score: 41/50 ##
- missed some questions which may have required some thinking
- In my opinion a decent score
- Surpassed the 25/50 threshold


## Question 5 ##

- Key takeaway: Although info about which restaurants Brandon and Cynthia have visited the past might be useful, they are not needed. 
- The most important piece of information out of the three is the information about food allergies and dietary restrictions.

## Question 14 ##

- Key takeaway: 8 is correct, but it would also display a check for 7. Since it displays 9 correctly, the only other option is 6. 
- The correct answer should have been B and D, not B and C. 

## Question 17 ##

- Key takeaway: Internet protocols standardize transmission, as it is a universal process. 

## Question 19 ##

- Key takeaway: A binary representation of 29 is more than 4 bits, therefore an overflow error will occur as the max in this program is 4. 

## Question 20 ##

- 4 bits can store 16 pieces of information, therefore it should easily store 8 pieces without overflowing. 

## Question 35 ##

- The default parameter should be on top. Therefore option A is correct and not option B.

## Question 36 ##

- i is initialized at 1. With the answer I chose, the initialization starts at 0. 

## Question 39 ##
![Question 39](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/776200516840456232/1038975057109725265/image.png)

- It has to be a positive integer. We cannot use anything else. 

## Question 50 ##
![Question 50](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/776200516840456232/1038975203805511680/image.png?width=955&height=612)

- The assignment of characters is incorrect in the answer choice that I chose. You would only need one more character for LastName.
