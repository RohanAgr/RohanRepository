# This is going to be a monumental task XD
> Me and Dillon will be sharing a common code, and then we deviate based on whatever theme we want to add

- We make a new Jupyter notebook for the code
- we hope to make a database to store information, and then we make a search engine
- The search engine will extract information from the database depending on what is searched
- Variables: we can use this to interchange the variables in between 2 code cells
- one code cell stores data, and the other code cell outputs the data
- we can classify and sort each input in the database (e.g. date of birth, height, other statistics)
- Me and Dillon might split this task into smaller problems, and we will specify who wrote which code cell.
- We can take inspiration from the Data Abstraction week and expand on it.
