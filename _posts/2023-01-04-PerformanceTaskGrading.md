# Performance Task 1

## Row 1: Program Purpose

- The video clearly demonstrates the running of the program (input, functionality, output)
- There is no description of a problem being solved or a creative interest being pursued. 
- POINTS AWARDED: 0

## Row 2: Data Abstraction
- There is a list which stores data in sideIndex.
- 2 code segments are given and the if loops are used heavily to execute the program
- POINTS AWARDED: 1

## Row 3: Managing Complexity

- The jit explained everything well, however there was this code segment which was not used in the program:
" sideIndex = ['A: B: C = ' + sideRatio, 'Equilateral', 'Isosceles', 'Scalene']
- This is an irrelevant piece of code as it does not execute in the argument. 
- POINTS AWARDED: 0

## Row 4: Procedural Abstraction

- There are two functions shown in the code, one related to the sideIndex list, and the other related to the calculations. 
- The code looks like it was student developed
- I don't see explicit parameters
- POINTS AWARDED: 0

## Row 5: Algorithm Implementation

- There are multiple iterations being conducted through if and for loops in order to determine the ratios for the side lengths.
- They select a string and output it
- There is sequencing in place, where they use a specific formula to calculate the ratios for each side length relative to another side length. (starts from A, then goes to B, and then C.)
- POINTS AWARDED: 1

### Overall Score: 2/5

# Performance Task 2

## Row 1: Program Purpose

- The student clearly states the purpose for the program was for entertainment
- The user input was from the mouse cursor, and then you press a key for the simulation to activate
- The program functions as intended
- POINTS AWARDED: 1

## Row 2: Data Abstraction

- There is a list being used (grids, cells)
- data can be stored or overwritten in order to correctly execute the simulation
- The code segments which create the data storage and ones that can overwrite / add data are separate. 
- POINTS AWARDED: 1

## Row 3: Managing Complexity

- The student used a list to consolidate all 10,800 items which will be subject to change in the program. Without the list, it would be extremely hard to manage all those items.
- The student does not explain if the code can be rewritten differently, or if the code fails to exist at all. 
- OVERALL SCORE: 0

## Row 4: Procedural Abstraction

- The procedure looks like it was student developed
- There is a clear procedure listed, and it explains how the code is running, step by step
- OVERALL SCORE: 1

## Row 5: Algorithm Implementation

- There is an algorithm in place using iterations and sequencing.
- Adequate use of nested if-else statements
- calling and checking functions
- OVERALL SCORE: 1

### Total Score: 4/5
