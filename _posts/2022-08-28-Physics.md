Stuff we learned in physics:

\- The equation used to find the electrical force is largely similar to the equation used for the force of gravity.

\- The force of electricity is generally many magnitudes larger than the force of gravity

\- electric fields are somewhat interesting

\- There is a positive and a negative charge
