## Overview

- A college professor surveyed Yale University's student body and noticed that a lot of people were stressed
- It affected their learning environment and negatively affected the student body and endeavors of Yale University
- There are many fallacies such as GI-Joe
- Knowing your mental situation is half the battle, and taking action is the other half
- They excitedly come to Yale but cannot function properly because of their depression or other mental situation


### What I learned
- 40% of students are extremely stressed
- 1/3 are so depressed that it is hard for them to function properly
- 40% feel hopeless in school
- 60% of people have developed a large amount of anxiety
- It is crazy that people are stressed to an extent that they cannot function properly at school, even in a prestigious university like Yale.
- It makes me want to regularly check myself and make sure I am not overly stressed to an extent where my performance drops.
