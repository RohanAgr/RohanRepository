# Overall Experience in the CS room in NATM
- This was probably the smoothest experience in Night At The Museum. Although the CS room was crowded there wasn't much commotion, and it was easy to navigate and find my assigned table. Our group had a solid presentation and we attracted a lot of people to view our project. 
- Other people's CS projects were also really cool, but I am most proud of our project this trimester.

# Overall NATM Experience
- It was very cool to see the various artworks. It was even more organized than last trimester. There were many repeat artworks, but I got to see computer animations show riggings and animations of Gru from Despicable Me. The band and orchestra played good music, and there were many creative pieces in ceramics, drawing / painting, and studio art. 

# Piece 1

- This is a piece about the Golden Gate Bridge. It is very detailed and it accurately depicts the landmark. The clouds also add some good flare to the piece. The water and other land features are also very good. 
- If I were to offer some critique, I would probably add a sun just to add some flair to the sky. 

# Piece 2

- One can make out a lot of human beings in that artpiece. The contrast of red and blue really helped with the overall feel of the piece. There is great attention to detail in this piece as well.
- I would have added more color just to make the piece a bit more lively and enticing to the viewer.
