# Me and Dillon made an app and quiz using AppLab
- it was fun lol xd
- We were introduced to JavaScript and used it in our app through block codes. We were able to see the plaintext when we changed a few settings.
- Our quiz was about Major League Baseball (again) and our app consisted of a drop down menu which gave a brief overview about the major wars fought by the West in the 20th century (World War I, World War II, Cold War)
- Our quiz has 10 questions and our app had 3 questions
- You can view the quiz [here](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/J-lBx4h4v1k3OqyW71ciH1YEPZZQtRH2tGEAmyO9CI8/edit)
- You can view the app [here](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/wzrgWNAQJlODZaqGA30EkKgbkzkFHkBL3OxUF4DxlHo/edit)

- Here is the plan that me and Dillon made before coding the app and the quiz:

| Component | Plan / Execution |
|---- | ------------|
| Home Page | Have an image of the MLB logo. Place a button below the logo and the quiz begins when we press start. |
| Questions | Here we can have all sorts of questions MLB related, such as MVP races, team names, trades, and more |
| Aesthetic Appeal | We can place images beside each question to make the screen look full. |
