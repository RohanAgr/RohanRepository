# Week of 8/22

- In class this week we got a brief overview of python and jupyter notebooks.
- We were shown a sample quiz and were tasked to create one of our own. 
- We had to use PowerShell and send pull requests to gain more file access from the APCSP repository. 
- We were introduced to bash and ran a few commands so everything was aligned.
