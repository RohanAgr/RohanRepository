# Performance Task 3

| Category | Points Awarded | Explanation | 
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | The video showed a clear demonstration of what was supposed to happen in the code. However, the written explanation left a lot to be desired. I did not see a problem being solved or some creative interest being pursued. | 
| Data Abstraction | 1 | Two code segments were shown. One had a list and the other had the list in action. | 
| Managing Complexity | 1 | The student implemented an array to store more than one variable, and explained what would happen if the array was not there. | 
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | The student had a set procedure which went over what goes on in the code. Multiple procedures are included. Parameters are also clearly defined. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | The student defines the function which is being used, and describes the loops / iterations. | 
| Testing | 1 | Calls were tested and the student did give one example. | 

# Performance Task 4

| Category | Points Awarded | Explanation | 
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | The program clearly works, the video shows everything the student wanted to show, and the program purpose does involve some creative aspect and interest being pursued. | 
| Data Abstraction | 1 | The student shows that the user types three things in, and the input is stored as a list. It is then used to generate a poem. | 
| Managing Complexity | 1 | Explains why the list manages complexity, and states that the student would have to use many variables to account for each item in the list. | 
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | The student explicitly states the parameters and how they follow a set procedure. The code segment shows where the calling occurs. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | The student thoroughly explains the algorithm used, and specifies the use of selections and iterations. | 
| Testing | 1 | Both calls are described, including how it works and what the desired result is. | 

# Performance Task 5

| Category | Points Awarded | Explanation | 
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | The student gives the purpose of the program, and it works as per the video. | 
| Data Abstraction | 1 | There are lists being used in the program, and other code segments are properly showing that list in use. | 
| Managing Complexity | 1 | The student mentions the effectiveness of the list, and the consequences of not using one. | 
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | The student clearly mentions what procedure they are using, and how it contributes to the overall code. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | The student uses a series of loops and list optimization in order to produce an effective program. | 
| Testing | 1 | Two calls are used, and the student explains the result and the intentions of both the calls. | 

# Performance Task 6

| Category | Points Awarded | Explanation | 
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | The student clearly shows the program purpose, and what the creative intent was behind it. | 
| Data Abstraction | 1 | There is a list called "guesses" and the following code segments show the list in use. | 
| Managing Complexity | 1 | Mentions how the user might have infinite guesses, and that it can get very complicated when trying to figure out which letter is right or in the right place. | 
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | The student does explain the procedure, and lists the parameters which the code fulfills. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | There is an algorithm called "check answer" with a series of if / then statements. | 
| Testing | 1 | There are two calls utilized, and the implementations and desired results are shown. | 

# Performance Task 7

| Category | Points Awarded | Explanation | 
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | The student gives the purpose of the program, and it works as per the video. | 
| Data Abstraction | 0 | The student met only 2 of the three required criteria for data abstraction. The 2nd code segment does not show the data being accessed from the list. | 
| Managing Complexity | 0 | The lists and correspondants could have easily been written in another way. | 
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | The student does not mention how the procedures contributes to the overall program. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | The student uses an algorithm and uses sequencing, iteration, and selection to execute the program. | 
| Testing | 1 | Two calls are used, and the student explains the result and the intentions of both the calls. | 

# Performance Task 8


| Category | Points Awarded | Explanation | 
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | The student gives the purpose of the program, and it works as per the video. | 
| Data Abstraction | 1 | There are lists being used in the program, and other code segments are properly showing that list in use. | 
| Managing Complexity | 1 | The student mentions the effectiveness of the list, and the consequences of not using one. | 
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | The student clearly mentions what procedure they are using, and how it contributes to the overall code. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | The student uses a series of loops and list optimization in order to produce an effective program. | 
| Testing | 1 | Two calls are used, and the student explains the result and the intentions of both the calls. | 

# Performance Task 9 

| Category | Points Awarded | Explanation | 
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | The student gives the purpose of the program, and it works as per the video. | 
| Data Abstraction | 0 | There are lists being used in the program, and other code segments are properly showing that list in use. | 
| Managing Complexity | 0 | The student mentions the effectiveness of the list, and the consequences of not using one. | 
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | The student clearly mentions what procedure they are using, and how it contributes to the overall code. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | The student uses a series of loops and list optimization in order to produce an effective program. | 
| Testing | 0 | Two calls are used, and the student explains the result and the intentions of both the calls. | 

# Performance Task 10

| Category | Points Awarded | Explanation | 
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | The student gives the purpose of the program, and it works as per the video. | 
| Data Abstraction | 1 | The description for the list is inaccurate. | 
| Managing Complexity | 1 | The student does not mention how the code could be rewritten without the list. | 
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | The student clearly mentions what procedure they are using, and how it contributes to the overall code. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | The student uses a series of loops and list optimization in order to produce an effective program. | 
| Testing | 1 | Two calls are used, and the student explains the result and the intentions of both the calls. |
