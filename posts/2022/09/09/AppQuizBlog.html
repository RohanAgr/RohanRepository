<ul>
  <li>it was fun lol xd</li>
  <li>We were introduced to JavaScript and used it in our app through block codes. We were able to see the plaintext when we changed a few settings.</li>
  <li>Our quiz was about Major League Baseball (again) and our app consisted of a drop down menu which gave a brief overview about the major wars fought by the West in the 20th century (World War I, World War II, Cold War)</li>
  <li>Our quiz has 10 questions and our app had 3 sections, one for each question and / or major event.</li>
  <li>We got the program to work without facing too many setbacks</li>
  <li>We included a lot of “on event” commands to allow for easy app and quiz navigation</li>
  <li>We found the overall process to be easy, but it was tedious writing the same “on event” command function over 10-20 times.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="key-takeaways">
<a class="anchor" href="#key-takeaways" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
  <li>AppLab is a great little platform to see how certain commands and variables work</li>
  <li>With the right planning and execution, a task which may seem hard at first gets a lot easier</li>
  <li>The data appeared to be stored in each screen, and the OnEvent command would allow for the code to call the input.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Resembled data abstraction</p>
  </li>
  <li>You can view the quiz <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/J-lBx4h4v1k3OqyW71ciH1YEPZZQtRH2tGEAmyO9CI8/edit">here</a>

  </li>
  <li>Here is the plan that me and Dillon made before coding the app and the quiz:</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Component</th>
      <th>Plan / Execution</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Home Page</td>
      <td>Have an image of the MLB logo. Place a button below the logo and the quiz begins when we press start.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Questions</td>
      <td>Here we can have all sorts of questions MLB related, such as MVP races, team names, trades, and more</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Aesthetic Appeal</td>
      <td>We can place images beside each question to make the screen look full. We can adjust the theme so it is easy on the eye.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
