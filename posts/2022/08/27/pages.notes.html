<h1 id="week-of-822">Week of 8/22</h1>

<ul>
  <li>In class this week we got a brief overview of python and jupyter notebooks.</li>
  <li>We were shown a sample quiz and were tasked to create one of our own.</li>
  <li>We had to use PowerShell and send pull requests to gain more file access from the APCSP repository.</li>
  <li>We were introduced to bash and ran a few commands so everything was aligned.</li>
</ul>
